# I am unsure of the details as of now, but I think I want to make either
# a ping-pong game which is similar to pong but adds gravity. However, i cant think
# of optional features to complete this.
# or a dungeon game where I use animation, have enemies, collectables such as
# coins, and a health bar. I also might decide to have more than one level, and a save
# point later on. I look forward to this project and am excited to try different things.
# for the dungeon thing, i am thinking of a game where you need to find a key, and unlock
# the door while evading the enemies.
